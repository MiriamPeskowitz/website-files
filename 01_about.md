Miriam Peskowitz likes to learn things, the more complex and interconnected and curious, the better. This thread connects all her writing, going back to her academic books on the history of judaism and on feminist theory, to her 2005 book The Truth Behind the Mommy Wars, to the breakout and internationally best-selling The Daring Book for Girls and its sequel, to the newest and latest and most wonderful, **Code Like a Girl: Rad Tech Projects and Practical Tips.**

**Code Like a Girl** comes out on August 13, 2019 and you can preorder now at your local bookstore, or at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079KSWTMX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), where they seem to have an extraordinary markdown. **Code Like a Girl** is for anyone who has been interested in code and tech but hasn't known where to start. It's the "here's-how-to-turn-on-the-button" intro, and I wrote it for middle school girls, and really, for everyone. The tone is welcoming and fun, and equal measure is paid to how to code and how to manage the frustration that comes with learning to code, with coding in Python and Scratch and using a breadboard to program LEDs and a motion sensor. So get a copy and you'll find yourself knee-deep in variables and loops, conditionals and circuits and more. 

And for the formal bio: Miriam Peskowitz, Ph.D. is the New York Times Bestselling Author of **The Daring Book for Girls**. Published by Harper Collins, it graced the New York Times list for 14 weeks, pulled the #1 spot on IndieSense, and was translated globally, managing to be most controversial in Australia. **Daring** was followed by **The Double-Daring Book for Girls** and two pocket versions; by games and toys and a video game; and by an international Burger King Happy Meal promotion and a PBS show. It is currently under option to be developed for TV. Miriam holds a Ph.D. from Duke University and an undergraduate degree from Oberlin College, and is perennially two weeks away from finishing the Fullstack Web Developer and Software Engineering program at the Flatiron School in New York. Her career has spanned being an Associate Professor at the University of Florida, to working with the LEGO company to create the first story bible for LEGO Friends. **Code Like a Girl: Rad Tech Projects and Practical Tips** is her latest book, and she has written at least three other books and numerous articles and blog posts. When not collecting new sets of knowledge and performing the alchemy of creating non-fiction books, she walks her dog, tinkers in her garden and stays up late with code.
