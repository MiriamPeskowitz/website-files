Look out world, Code Like a Girl arrives on August 13, 2019. Ever wanted to know how to code? This is your entry. Starts with Scratch, goes to Python. Puts together a computer from a Raspberry Pi, goes to motion sensors that send you emails. Start knowing very little. Leave understanding the Internet of Things. Written with love and fascination for building things and telling stories about code and with code. Code Like a Girl is a how-to-code book for Middle School girls, and for everyone. 



>Finished Code Like A Girl just now too. @MiriamPeskowitz knocks it out of the park with this coding basics book for middle schoolers. Every tween/teen in my@life is getting this book for the holidays this year --@merbroussard
